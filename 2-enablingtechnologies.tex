\begin{chapterintro}
This chapter introduces which technologies have made possible this project. First of all there must be an engine to build the game application, this is Unity game engine, explained in section \ref{sec:unity}. Secondly, Unity integrates third part software as plugins to facilitate development through its Asset Store, this components are detailed in section \ref{sec:assetstore}. Finally, there should be a tool to manage application metrics and information after its deployment, this is done by Flurry Analytics, explained in section \ref{sec:flurry}.

\section{Unity3D game engine}
\label{sec:unity}
Todayâ€™s game creators rely on game engines to develop the main pieces of software for their games. A game engine simplifies the task of the programmers by offering convenient abstractions for the hardware and operating systems on top of which the game runs.~\cite{messaoudi2015dis}

Gamers play on so many different types of devices which have lots of differences regarding their hardware and software resources. One of the main purposes of a game engine is to make this development easier avoiding building one application for each device we want to be compatible with.

Unity3D game engine is an integrated development tool for producing other interactive contents such as video game, architectural visualization, real -time 3D animation. Its editor runs on Window, Mac OS X, so it could make games as the platforms of Window, Mac, Wii, iPad, and iPhone. It could also produce web browser game that uses unity web player plug-in.~\cite{kim2014dev}

Unity3D is a flexible and high-performance development platform used to make creative and intelligent interactive 3D and 2D experiences. The "author once, deploy everywhere" capability ensures developers can publish to all of the most popular platforms. Unity Technologies boasts a thriving community of over 2 million developers including large publishers, indie studios, students and hobbyists. To remain at the forefront of innovation, Unity Technologies tirelessly re-invests in its award-winning 3D development tools and its democratization initiatives, such as the Asset Store digital content marketplace and Unity Games publishing and distribution division.~\cite{unity2013press}
