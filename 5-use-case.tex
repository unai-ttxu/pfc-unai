\chapter{Case study}

\begin{chapterintro}
In this chapter we are going to describe two selected use cases that represents how the gamer will interact with the application.
Firstly, we will describe the gamer interaction with the playing instrument game mode. Secondly, we will study the conduct orchestra game mode

\section{Introduction}

In both use cases, two actors are involved, the gamer and the instrument recognition algorithm.

In the following sections we will explain two of the principal application game modes:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{Playing instrument game mode} detailed in section \ref{sec:playinginstrumentgm}.
\item \textit{Conducting orchestra game mode} detailed in section \ref{sec:conductingorchestragm}.
\end{itemize}

The \textit{Gamer} is able to access to both game modes from the application home screen, using one of the physical instrument miniature. Within each game mode, the gamer is able to interact with every component in order to select other musical instrument, change melodies, play an instrument, watch a play instrument demo, choose what instruments must be playing, etc.

The \textit{Instrument recognition algorithm} allows the application engine to detect which physical instrument miniature has been placed on the screen recognition zones. As a result, the gamer is able to interact with the game mode using the physical instrument miniatures.
