This thesis is the result of a project whose objective is to develop a multi-platform mobile musical training software for children using the framework Unity3D engine.

This multi-platform development development cover several processes: requirement analysis, architecture design, videogame implementation, testing this implementation and iOs and Android deployments.

Moreover, we use plugins obtained through Unity3D Asset Store, which allow us to improve the videogame performance and make its development easier.

Furthermore, we have integrate Flurry Analytics as a metrics an error tool management in order to facilitate the future application maintenance.

Finally, we gather the extracted conclusions and check if we achieve the goals defined in the analysis requirement stage.
